# Leaddev/StaffPlus 2021
This conference took place on the 14th September 2021.

This was the first time Leaddev did a staffplus track. There were 3 tracks but I only followed the StaffPlus one as it seemed more interesting to me.

All videos are available from [leaddev.com](https://leaddev.com/course/leaddev-live?vgo_ee=L1TlqoRqLUNMkRHKcvr6yLyTHSQN%2BDtnb0JgEo8gVWY%3D).

## What is a StaffPlus role?

I went in not really understanding these roles very well. StaffPlus describes the senior end of the "individual contributor path" after senior engineer, which includes titles like Staff Engineer, Senior Staff Engineer, Principal Staff Engineer, Distinguished Engineer.

[StaffEng](https://staffeng.com/) is a good starting point.

It seems like it's hard to talk about these roles in a general way because it varies so much between organisations, and this path "tops out" at different places in different organisations.
Many of the speakers were from quite large engineering organisations.

### Adding perspective
One of the speakers said the way you can leverage experience as a staff engineer is by bringing hard-earned knowledge of *safety engineering* to teams that are only thinking about *product engineering*.
Safety engineering becomes more important in larger organisations where people are less willing to take big risks. Basically you are "adult supervision" for people who get excited about stuff. You think about thinks might fail.

Yonatan Zunger shared his article [Privacy, Triage, and Risk](https://www.usenix.org/conference/pepr19/presentation/zunger).

Life experience can also be valuable for empathising with how your software impacts real people.

### Systems thinking
The "I" in IC seems to be getting less relevant these days and the speakers empahsised systems thinking. "IC is a decomplexifier" "cut through the organisational cruft" "debug the organisation"

In a StaffPlus role you can have a big impact by reducing [toil](https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/). There was some discussion about "developer experience" becoming more of a thing. Somebody shared [The Show Must Go On: Securing Netflix Studios At Scale](https://netflixtechblog.com/the-show-must-go-on-securing-netflix-studios-at-scale-19b801c86479) which talks about building internal capability through engineering.

### Scope
Your "domain" or scope of responsibility naturally increases as you move into more senior positions. You also need to be more aware of the larger business context your area of responsibility sits within.
This can be hard if your organisation is bad at communicating and you have people filtering that information from you. A staffplus role should expose you to the problems of the business.

## Skills and behaviours
### Develop a skillset beyond the technical skills
In [Role and Influence: The IC trajectory beyond Staff](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/role-and-influence-ic-trajectory-beyond-staff), Yonatan Zunger described senior roles as a balance of 4 jobs:

1. A core technical skill you specialise in (for me, software engineering)
2. Product management (see [Product owner onboarding checklist](https://unremarkabletester.com/2021/05/05/my-product-owner-onboarding-checklist/))
3. Project management (see [How to lead a project - as a software engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/how-to-lead-a-project-in-software-development/))
4. People management

You will be a co-leader with other people with a different balance of these skills (you will deliver the same messages, help each other with networking and context)

You will have some degree of competence in all of them but will play to your strengths and lean on other people to fill in the gaps. Lots of talk in slack about T shaped skills and "Broken Comb" shapes.

Intercom promotes [the engineering/manager pendulum](https://www.intercom.com/blog/engineering-management-benefits/) rather than management being a fork in the road.

The [session lab library](https://www.sessionlab.com/library) was recommended in chat for facilitating workshops and meetings.

### Bridge the technical and non-technical
- Be adaptive
- Be aware of your context
- Tie technical needs to business needs
 
"whatever needs to be done to get to where we all want to go"

### Lead and guide others
You will guide others towards a larger context and flag things that need attention

- Silvia Botros said that "my job is to help the company go in a stategic direction" where there is a multi-year strategy. Resolves misalignment problems by escalating them.

You can have impact across the organisation through mentorship.

Some recommended resources:

- Anarchists Guide book
- Team Topologies - good for delivering a complicated project

- [SRE Apprentives](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/sre-apprentices/)

### Contrast with Hyperspecialist
A StaffPlus role is not a hyperspecialist. It's more of a senior generalist role.

Anecodotally, hyperspecialist is still a possible career path but it seems to be less in demand these days.

If you specialise in multiple technical skills you can still act as a bridge between roles.

### How do we practice these skills
- It's hard because of the slow feedback cycles
- Could there be Katas?
- Outside of work, volunteering or open source is a great way
- People mentioned the [Wheel of Misfortune](https://awesomeopensource.com/project/dastergon/wheel-of-misfortune) and Julia Evans' debugging games as good examples for practicing skills that are usually learned through experience

## Progressing to a StaffPlus role
### Career advice
Coraline Ada Ehmke: [Understand your own values and set boundaries.](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/luminary-interview-coraline-ada-ehmke) Don't compromise too much for salary/title/position.

StaffPlus responsibilities should replace more hands on stuff; don't just try and do extra stuff on top. Talk to managers about helping to grow others (by delegation).

You can set your own goals and share them with the people you work with. Include how you will work with teams, how you plan to deliver on your goals, what it means in practice. [Sabrina Leandro breaks down her quarterly goals into 6 week milestones, and then sets weekly plans.](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/so-youre-staff-now-what)

Other examples of personal planning:
- [David Daly's yearly reflection and planning](https://www.daviddaly.me/2020/01/my-yearly-reflection-and-planning.html)

### Similarities to roles I have done in the past
- The focus on mentoring and building capability in the organisation is very similar to my experience as a senior engineer and TL, especially when I was in the civil service
- Partnering with a manager at the same level (probably a manager of managers) is a bit like working with product managers and delievery managers. In past roles I have also worked in partnership with people at a higher level to me.
- Working at the intersection of tech and people systems reminds me of contributing to working groups at MOJ (incident response and data standards) and community projects at GDS (learning pathways, conf talks we love) which I enjoyed a lot

### Differences from roles I have done in the past
- Most people in these roles sit across many teams instead of just one.
- You don't do all these things in addition to an engineer role, you do this *instead of* shipping code.
- Lots of time is spent on the design of techno-social systems (or whatever the word is)
- Lots more delegating
- Your influence tends to be sideways rather than up and down

## How to influence (without authority)
- Keep asking questions
- Talk about unsaid parts of decision making - decisions can be biased by organisational incentives
- Senior sponsors can get you a seat at the table, but you still have to do the work
- If you reach a different decision, you could have different information or different values. Start by checking you have the same information.
- Long form writing is a superpower. You can look inwards at what can be done better.
- Find out who cares about what.
- The goal is to be neutral. [Diane Tang](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/luminary-interview-diane-tang) spends much of her time with teams that don't report to her. She is user focused and can recommend solutions and shape conversations.

Relationships with managers can fail when
- there is a lack of trust (e.g. no autonomy* to make decisions/empower others; high level executors are just given projects to execute instead of being involved earlier)
- you get pidgeon holed into particular roles
- there is poor communication of business problems

*There are different scopes for autonomy: Personal, Team, Department, Company

## Widening your influence
- Your role may be clear within a team but unclear outside of it. You need to broadcast that information out
- When you are setting your own goals, you can disseminate that to people you intend to work with and explain how you can work together

## Global vs local optimisation
- When setting standards/processes you can think of it like a distributed system - there are a range of approaches that trade off a consistent experience and the ability to work in parallel
- Where you fall depends on organisation size

## Persuasion and information gathering
- Turn statements into questions
- Talk less, listen more
- Explicitly ask "what do you care about" "what top of mind" "what keeps you up at night"
- Make it data-driven
- Provide summarised information

## Technical writing
- Undervalued becaused the feedback loop is slower than writing code but *WRITING IS THINKING*
- Record constraints and options not picked
- Define a clear audience
- Pin docs in slack for common questions - this frees up your time for higher leverage stuff

## Calling out the current situation
- "we don't know - let's figure it out"
- "the way x+y is working together means we can't move forward"
- "this solution doesn't meet this requirement - how do we address that?"

## Developer experience = productivity
- Observability
- Reliability
- Making sure documentation is up to date
- Make sure technical debt is paid down

## Rapid scaling
Samantha Schaevitz presented [How we grew Google meet 50x during COVID-19](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/scaling-incident-management-how-we-grew-google-meet-50x-during-covid19)

They had 3 objectives

1. Avoid outages (and failing that, degrade gracefully)
2. Increase serving capacity
3. Forecast demand

This talk was interesting because they described an incident response where
- the incident was ongoing rather than returning to normal within a day
- they pre-emptively declared an incident rather than waiting for things to break
- people were not expected to be 100% available

They set up standby roles for all executive roles in the incident response, who shadowed all meetings and were ready to jump in at any point. Some people in the chat questioned the cost of this, but it reminded me of job sharing arrangements, which seem more resiliant than depending on a single person.

They set up very structured workstreams for the duration of the incident so that different workstreams could continue in parallel.

- Dependency issues
- Bottlenecks
- Control knobs to ease capacity (e.g. degrading video quality, switching off captions)
- Productionising (automating ad-hoc solutions)

This sounded like it would reduce the pressure of trying to balance multiple things at once. The dependency stream can focus on building relationships with other teams and influencing their work. Bottlenecks stream can focus on investigation. Control knobs stream can focus on quick implementation. Productionising stream can think about efficiency and reliability without having to rush to get *something* live.

The workstreams approach reminded me a bit of how we approached ExpertTrack when we were under tight deadlines. Except that in this case they acknowledged it as an incident rather than business as usual.

Things that helped structure the work:
- Agreeing shared terminology
- Setting up google groups for each workstream

## Technical strategy
These two talks both advised on strategy:

- [Technical strategy power chords](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/technical-strategy-power-chords)
- [To kill it with fire, or not kill it with fire](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-live/kill-it-fire-or-not-kill-it-fire)

### Pick only one goal
e.g. lower error rates to < 1%, run migrations through an automatic pipeline, increase throughput of X to Y%

You want to avoid tension between goals and allow simple solutions to be found. You can't do this if you have multiple goals that can conflict

**The approach can be multifaceted but the outcome should be simple**

### List the facts that would change your mind
i.e. the key underpinning assumptions

### Solve only the hard problem you absolutely need to

### Work backwards
Strategy is not just a start/end state - it has to be executable like a recipe.

Don't overspecify the end state, because your context will change

### Killing it with fire
This is a high consequence decision that can affect teams for years and has ripple effects throughout the organisation

There are many options

- Turndown
- Migration
- Modernisation
- Live with it

You also need to consider external dependencies beyond the owning team

When considering migrations you might need prototyping or additional staffing during the migration period.

You should articulate your principles that should guide the migration e.g. risk appetite (users should not be 
ed)
