# Cross government API community of interest meetup - 2019-05-01

## Themes
- Different approaches to government as a platform
- How to do data sharing
- Data standards

## Takeaways
- UK gov is really badly structured; doesn't lend itself to data ownership/sharing
- Legislation says no
- Too much focus on services = user facing services
- There are different patterns of API usage - maybe useful to catalog these rather than talking out APIs as a big nebulous thing
- "Tell us once" is a really powerful principal

## Presentations

## Richard Pope on GaaP across the world
### India
Adahar is part of India stack. Problems and opportunities.

Aspiration is paperless, cashless society.

Have created new institutions. Have institutions outside of government (ISpirit) working on gov tech.

### Aregentina
- Have a split between API teams and service teams
- Daniel Abady: Departments should become APIs
### Estonia
- Soft power
- Interoperability and trade with other countries
- Now starting to focus on life events and service design (are they in a better position now they've invested in infrastructure?)

### China
- Social credit is just registers of people + data sharing
- But it's scary because it's opaque (huge contrast with Estonian model)

### France
- Has APIs for registers (e.g. wine appelations!)

### US
- Much more API focused
- Managers have an obligation to consider the wider organisation

## Safeguards
- Lesson to be learned from NHS/Home Office data sharing

## Funding
- How should treasury assess businesses for platform/API projects?

## Hackney
[HackIT manifesto](https://hackit.org.uk/how-we-work/hackit-manifesto)

Showing the value of API/Platform work:
- With monolithic/tightly coupled legacy systems, technology changes become a threat to your core business. Breaking things apart protects against that
- User need for up to date and reliable information

Measuring success of an API strategy:
- Collaboration
- Innovation
- Reuse

Want to train people, so consider it a sign of success if devs get headhunted.

## ONS
Need for a public API was well known. Set up a team to do it. Product manager was used to work on front end services, so structure of the team was different. Less voices; just him and devs.

Lots more tricky compromises to make that could have consequences later on. Product manager needs to understand more of the detail to make informed decisions.

Recognising the server side iceberg.

Try to understand what you can do up front vs what you can iterate on later.

Tools like postman and swagger are used by the PM for testing the team have built the right thing.

Asking questions important. Need to ask in a way so you can understand the answers and get at the value.

User research involved giving homework to participants: make a thing with this data, come back and tell us about it.

## NCSC on reviewing APIs
Big issues similar to web applications in general.

### CORS misconfiguration

CORS is two headers: one allows you to whitelist origins, and the other lets you share cookies/credentials. There is a restriction that says you can't use a wildcard for origin while sharing cookies/credentials. But teams oftern try to work around this on the server side.

### CSRF

People often focus on forms in web apps but overlook CSRF in APIs.

Good design avoids this (don't do dangerous things in GET).

Generate unique token on login for use with follow up requests.

Single origin policy prevents browser from processing resposnes, but doesn't prevent server from processing the request.

### Client certificate authentication misconfiguration
Used where you have an internal userbase. Works well with things like active directory.

Didn't quite follow this but the vulnerability happens where you only validate certs on initial login, but an attacker can intercept session credentials and impersonate you.

Avoided by checking the cert and checking the session belongs to the cert.

### Insufficient access control and data validation
Problems arise when your API processes overly complex objects, i.e. the "god object" antipattern - avoid this.

Teams sometimes don't do the same authorization checks on the server side as client side. So if you have a form that shows extra fields to users with escalated privileges, you also need to make sure you check the privileges again once that data is submitted back to the API.

## HMRC Accessible 3rd party tax software

## DVSA API to aggregate vehicle checks

## Canada's digital backbone

## Adopting OpenAPI 3 as a standard
