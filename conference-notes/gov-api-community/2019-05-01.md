# Cross government API community of interest meetup - 2019-05-01

## Themes
- Different approaches to government as a platform
- How to do data sharing
- Data standards

## Takeaways
- UK gov is really badly structured; doesn't lend itself to data ownership/sharing
- Legislation says no
- Too much focus on services = user facing services
- There are different patterns of API usage - maybe useful to catalog these rather than talking out APIs as a big nebulous thing
- "Tell us once" is a really powerful principal

## Presentations

## Richard Pope on GaaP across the world
### Estonia
- Soft power
- Interoperability and trade with other countries
- Now starting to focus on life events and service design (are they in a better position now they've invested in infrastructure?)

### China
- Social credit is just registers of people + data sharing
- But it's scary because it's opaque (huge contrast with Estonian model)

### France
- Has APIs for registers (e.g. wine appelations!)

### US
- Much more API focused
- Managers have an obligation to consider the wider organisation

## Safeguards
- Lesson to be learned from NHS/Home Office data sharing

## Funding
- How should treasury assess businesses for platform/API projects?

Showing the value of API/Platform work:
- With monolithic/tightly coupled legacy systems, technology changes become a threat to your core business. Breaking things apart protects against that
- User need for up to date and reliable information

Measuring success of an API strategy:
- Collaboration
- Innovation
- Reuse

Want to train people, so consider it a sign of success if devs get headhunted.
