GOV.UK Frankentaxonomy
======================

Currently, GOV.UK does not have a simple structure.

There are two distinct "places" on GOV.UK: "Mainstream" and "Inside government".

This structure is most visible to users in the footer at the bottom of each page:

Mainstream is very subject-oriented whereas inside government is organised primarily by organisation and policy area (so you need to understand how government works to navigate it).

This has led to multiple distinct ways of browsing by subject:
- [Mainstream browse](https://www.gov.uk/browse)
- [Organisation home pages](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations)
- [Policy areas](https://www.gov.uk/government/topics)
- [Policies](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies)
- [Topics](https://www.gov.uk/topic) aimed at specialist users

These things currently have no relationships to each other, which makes it very difficult
to understand where you are on GOV.UK.

They also have varying scopes: each of them organises a different slice of GOV.UK content.

Single subject-based taxonomy
-----------------------------
The GOV.UK finding things project aims to organise the whole of GOV.UK (hundreds of thousands of documents) under a common classification scheme (the "single subject-based taxonomy") so that users can quickly find and understand information on a topic.

This is being developed piece by piece starting with education content.

This mockup
-----------
The goal of this mockup is to show how the navigation structure of GOV.UK could evolve towards a single browse hierarchy while the new taxonomy is being developed.

It's called the frankentaxonomy because it's an attempt to link together multiple hierarchies so that users can understand where they are in broad terms.

 If you land in the "wrong section", you should be able to course correct; for example if you land on the "inside government" part of GOV.UK and you're actually looking for basic information about benefits entitltement, your best bet is to navigate back up the homepage and click "benefits".

The structure of top level topics can be iterated one at a time without breaking this model of how GOV.UK fits together.
