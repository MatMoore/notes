# Learning Korean

These are my notes from learning some Korean.

I want to set small goals for myself and keep track of things I can practice to improve my reading, writing, listening and speaking.

I've grouped the notes into various topics, which roughly follow the textbook I'm using (Sogang Korean 1A), but I'm also gathering links to lots of free online resources.
